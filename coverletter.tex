Dear Astyra Hiring Manager,
%SDG\&E Hiring Manager,

My experience working as a GIS analyst in a diverse range of projects with
professionals from multiple sectors and disciplines for over nine years makes me
a strong candidate for your \impt{GIS Analyst} position.

%With over nine years of experience, I have been working on GIS and spatial data
%problems in a wide variety of projects, collaborating with technical specialists to
%develop GIS products and analyses that meet their information needs.

I meet all of the Knowledge and Skills requirements in the job description.  I
have been \impt{administrating GIS applications} and software for most of my
career, including installing hardware and software.  I have been
\impt{collecting, cleaning, analyzing}, and \impt{evaluating spatial data} in
most of my past projects, including digitizing paper and digital maps.  I also
have a background in software development and am \impt{proficient programming in
Python}.

I have worked with and \impt{maintained computer equipment} including printers and
plotters, along with GPS units.  I have worked with and consolidated data in a
wide range of formats.  I have strong communication skills, working with both
technical and non-technical clients and customers, understanding their needs to
develop analyses to meet their requirements.  I have also worked with sensitive
information in challenging environments.  From the beginning of my career I have
worked with ArcGIS/ArcMap and more recently ArcGIS Pro.

%I have used a wide range of GIS and data analysis tools and software packages.
%From the beginning of my career I have used ArcGIS to develop and clean data,
%consolidate disparate data sources, and produce high-quality maps and posters.
%I use Safe FME to design standardized ETL workflows and spatial data pipelines.
%I develop applications, toolboxes, and web services primarily in Python.

I live in San Diego, having recently moved from Canada, and have just received
my green card. I look forward to hearing from you.  


Sincerely,\\
