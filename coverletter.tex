%Dear \JobManagerShort,
Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my keen interest in the
\impt{\JobTitle} role at {\JobCompany}.
As a passionate GIS and mapping professional with over 9 years of
experience, I am particularly drawn to SANDAG's GIS department's
mission focusing on 
environmental conservation, population and economic growth forecasting, and land use modeling.
My expertise in \impt{creating maps, geospatial data products}, and other data
aligns perfectly with the requirements you have outlined.

Throughout my career, I have consistently delivered
impactful results in the geospatial field.
For example, in my previous role at BC Transit I worked closely with
planners and local councils to map transit issues and model 
\impt{patterns of population movement}.
%At Congruex I have designed and implemented a
%containerized cloud API infrastructure using Python on Azure.
%This solution, consisting of 19 geospatial analysis, reporting, and data management endpoints,
%\impt{increased data accessibility} for project managers by 25\%, allowing them to
%extract actionable insights and improve decision-making.
My experience also includes collaborating with cross-functional teams to
develop algorithms and applications to ensure the quality of operational data sets.

My technical skillset includes:
\vspace{-12pt}
\begin{itemize} \itemsep 0pt
\item Knowledge of spatial modeling techniques
\item Advanced proficiency in Python
\item Professional experience with FME
\item Certifications with cloud platforms AWS and Azure
%\item Proven ability to design and implement scalable data pipelines using Apache Airflow
%\item Strong analytical and problem-solving skills honed through years of experience
\item Proficiency with ESRI ArcGIS products, notably ArcGIS Pro
\item Extensive experience with relational databases and spatial SQL, including writing triggers and functions
\end{itemize}

I am confident that my skills and experience would be a valuable asset to your team and
am eager to learn more about how I can contribute to your team's continued success.
Thank you for your time and consideration.
