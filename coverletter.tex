Dear Hiring Manager,

Your vision to create positive global impact and leave the world in a better position than when we came
resonates directly with my personal and professional aspirations.
The prospect of contributing to a company that leverages
business process improvement and the use of technology to enable transformation 
is particularly compelling.

With over 10 years of experience, I have designed, built, and deployed scalable
geospatial services, analyses, applications and spatial data pipelines.
I have worked with AI and ML systems, including Large Language Models (LLMs).
Additionally, I have extensive experience working closely with clients and colleagues
of all technical levels, developing and deploying geospatial analyses.

Specifically, my expertise includes:  
\begin{itemlist}
\item Proficiency in using statistical tools to provide diagnostic and predictive analytics
\item Expert use of ArcGIS Pro, AGOL, and ModelBuilder
\item Advanced use of Python, R, SQL, M, Power Query, and DAX
\item Creating and managing Relational Geodatabases both file-based and DB server-based
\end{itemlist}

My skills and passion for applying geospatial technology to tough
challenges directly supports SREâ€™s mission. 
I am confident my experience and dedication would make me a valuable asset to your team. 
Thank you for your time and consideration. 
I look forward to discussing how my experience can contribute to Strategic Resolution Experts Inc.

Sincerely,\\
