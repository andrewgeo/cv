Dear Hiring Manager,

Your mission to reverse climate change through agricultural innovation aligns directly with my professional aspirations and extensive experience in advanced geospatial solutions.  The prospect of contributing to a company that leverages agronomy, remote sensing, and AI for scalable, sustainable agriculture is particularly compelling.

With over 10 years of experience, I have designed, built, and deployed scalable APIs, geospatial data pipelines, and high-volume production systems on major cloud platforms (AWS and Azure). At Congruex, I led the development of a cloud-based API infrastructure (Python/FastAPI on Azure), delivering 19 data services that provided critical business insights. At Picarro, I enhanced spatial ETL pipelines, improving reliability and reducing manual intervention through custom Python tools.

My expertise includes:
 * Raster/vector data manipulation using GDAL, Rasterio, Shapely, and ArcPy.
 * REST API development with FastAPI and Flask frameworks.
 * Large-scale geospatial arrays (NumPy, xarray, Dask).
 * Relational databases (PostgreSQL with PostGIS): proficient in geospatial data queries, spatial indexes, geometry types, and geospatial joins.
 * ETL orchestration with Airflow.
 * Deployment of OGC-compliant services (WMS, WFS) with GeoServer.

My skills and passion for applying geospatial technology to tough
challenges directly supports Regrowâ€™s mission. I am confident my experience and dedication would make me a valuable asset to your team. Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to discussing how my experience can contribute to Regrow Ag Inc.

Sincerely,
Andrew Ross



Sincerely,\\
