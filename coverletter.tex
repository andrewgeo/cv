Dear Hiring Manager:

\iffalse
\fi

My extensive GIS and mapping experience working on wide range of projects and
technologies makes me a strong candidate for your \impt{\CVjobTitle} position
at \CVcompany.

With over \impt{nine years of experience}, I have been working with GIS systems
and \impt{collecting field data} in many different types of
projects, listening to customers and clients discussing their needs and
requirements, in order to develop GIS maps, analyses, and solutions that meet
their business goals.  
Technically I have \impt{advanced skills with ArcGIS}
desktop and ArcGIS pro, and have developed plugins and tools with Python.

I live in San Diego and am a legal permanent resident.  

Thank you for considering my application.
I look forward to hearing from you.  


Sincerely,\\
