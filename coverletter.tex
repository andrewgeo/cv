Dear Hiring Manager:

My experience 
managing spatial data and working on complex projects
with industry standard GIS tools and technologies, makes me
a strong candidate for your \impt{\CVjobTitle} position at \CVcompany.

With over \impt{four years of professional experience}, I have been 
working with customers and clients, discussing their needs and requirements, 
in order to develop GIS maps, analyses and solutions that meet their business
goals.  Technically I have been using \impt{ESRI ArcGIS} and ArcMap to
\impt{digitize spatial and tabular data}, build spatial databases, 
and write \impt{Python} software to facilitate analysis and data management.

I live in San Diego and am a legal permanent resident.  

Thank you for considering my application.
I look forward to hearing from you.  


Sincerely,\\
