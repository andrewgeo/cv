Dear Hiring Manager,

Your mission to
deliver top-notch solutions to our customers’ most difficult problems
%reverse climate change through agricultural innovation
aligns directly with my professional aspirations and extensive experience in advanced geospatial solutions.
The prospect of contributing to a company that combines and leverages
digital transformation, location intelligence, and data science
%agronomy, remote sensing, and AI for scalable, sustainable agridatculture
is particularly compelling.

With over 10 years of experience, I have designed, built, and deployed scalable
geospatial services, analyses, applications and spatial data pipelines.
I have worked with AI and ML systems, including Large Language Models (LLMs).
Additionally, I have extensive experience working closely with clients and colleagues
of all technical levels, developing and deploying geospatial analyses.

Specifically, my expertise includes:  
\begin{itemlist}
\item Proficiency in using statistical tools to provide diagnostic and predictive analytics
\item Expert use of ArcGIS Pro, AGOL, and ModelBuilder
\item Advanced use of Python, R, SQL, M, Power Query, and DAX
\item Creating and managing Relational Geodatabases both file-based and DB server-based
\end{itemlist}

My skills and passion for applying geospatial technology to tough
challenges directly supports SRE’s mission. 
I am confident my experience and dedication would make me a valuable asset to your team. 
Thank you for your time and consideration. 
I look forward to discussing how my experience can contribute to Strategic Resolution Experts Inc.
My work involves establishing data governance, quality assurance and quality control (QA/QC)
policies and guidelines to ensure data, processes and workflows adhere to high standards.
I have designed geospatial databases and worked at consolidating
a wide range of data into comprehensive analyses and reports to generate
insights and support clients and customers at all technical levels.
%With over 10 years of experience, I have designed, built, and deployed scalable
%APIs, geospatial data pipelines, and high-volume production systems on major
%cloud platforms (AWS and Azure). At Congruex, I led the development of a
%cloud-based API infrastructure (Python/FastAPI on Azure), delivering 19 data
%services that provided critical business insights. At Picarro, I enhanced
%spatial ETL pipelines, improving reliability and reducing manual intervention
%through custom Python tools.

Specifically, my expertise includes:
\begin{itemlist}
\item Proficiency in using statistical tools to provide diagnostic and predictive analytics
\item Expert use of ArcGIS Pro, AGOL, and QGIS
\item Advanced use of Python, SQL, and MS Power BI
