%Dear \JobManagerShort,
Dear Hiring Manager,

I am eager to apply for the Data Solutions Engineer position and contribute to Schmidt Ocean Institute's mission.
With over a decade of experience architecting resilient data pipelines and a deep understanding of the
complexities involved in managing and distributing geospatial data at scale,
including the unique challenges of geospatial and temporal information, I am confident in my ability to immediately contribute to enhancing the visibility
and utilization of SOI's invaluable oceanic and atmospheric datasets.

Specifically, my background aligns with SOI's core needs in three key areas.
First, my proficiency in developing and optimizing spatial data pipelines is evidenced by my work at Picarro and Congruex, where I designed and implemented
ETL processes to enhance data flow and ensure data quality.
Second, my strong command of Python, as highlighted in my skills and demonstrated through
projects like the API development at Congruex and the ETL pipeline at BC Transit, positions me to
readily contribute to your scientific programming
efforts.
Finally, my experience in developing and deploying API infrastructures and overseeing corporate mapping
platforms at Congruex showcases my proven ability to manage and build the data systems essential for increasing the
accessibility and usability of SOI’s scientific data.

I believe you will find that my experience is a strong fit for Schmidt Ocean
Institute’s mission and this specific position.
I am ready to leverage my skills within your team and look forward to hearing from you.

Sincerely,\\
